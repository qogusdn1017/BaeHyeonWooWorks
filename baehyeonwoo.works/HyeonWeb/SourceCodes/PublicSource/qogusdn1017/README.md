> - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)]. Making Minecraft Plugins for [[Paper](https://papermc.io/)] Servers for fun. Sometimes I use [[Spigot](https://spigotmc.org/)] too.

> - Seriously, Iâ€™m currently learning **nothing.** I'm just enjoying writing codes. That's all. I even don't know how to start writing codes.

> - What I'm really learning is After Effects only. Used to make YouTube Videos such as Minecraft and 'Rustic Period'(The Age of a Wild Man) synthesis videos.
